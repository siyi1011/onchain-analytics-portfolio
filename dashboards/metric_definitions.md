# Metric Definitions (DEX Activity)

Scope: DEX activity metrics (initially for Uniswap-style AMMs)
Granularity: Daily (by date)
Currency: USD where applicable

## 1) Volume (USD)
Definition: Total swap volume in USD over a period.
Calculation: Sum of amountUSD across all swap events during the day.
Why it matters: Measures trading demand and activity.
Caveats: Depends on USD conversion; can be inflated by wash trading/incentives.

## 2) Swap Count (Transactions)
Definition: Number of swaps in a period.
Calculation: Count swap events per day.
Why it matters: Frequency proxy; often less skewed than volume.
Caveats: Bots/routers may distort; one tx can include multiple swaps.

## 3) Unique Traders (Daily Active Traders)
Definition: Distinct trader addresses executing >=1 swap per day.
Calculation: COUNT(DISTINCT trader) over swaps per day.
Why it matters: Breadth of participation and adoption proxy.
Caveats: Users may use multiple addresses; router attribution issues.

## 4) Liquidity / TVL Proxy (USD)
Definition: Value locked in pools (USD).
Calculation: Use protocol TVL metric if available; else aggregate reserves * price.
Why it matters: Market depth / slippage resilience proxy.
Caveats: Methodology differs across sources; double counting risk.

## 5) Fees (USD)
Definition: Fees generated by swaps (USD).
Calculation: fees = volume * fee_rate (if not directly available) or sum feesUSD.
Why it matters: Revenue proxy; key for sustainability.
Caveats: Fee tier varies by pool; protocol vs LP fee split differs by version.
